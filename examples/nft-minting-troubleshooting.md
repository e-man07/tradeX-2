# NFT Minting Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Errors and Solutions

### "AccountNotFoundError: The account of type [MintAccount] was not found"

This error typically means:

1. **The collection address is incorrect** - Double-check your collection address:
   - Make sure you've copied the full address without any typos
   - Verify that you're using the correct address (the "collectionAddress" from your collection creation response)
   - Ensure you're on the same network (Devnet/Mainnet) as the collection

2. **Collection with that address doesn't exist yet** - The transaction for creating your collection may not be finalized:
   - Wait a few minutes for the Solana network to process your collection creation transaction
   - Check the collection address on [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/) to verify it exists

3. **Network issues** - Solana RPC nodes might be experiencing temporary issues:
   - Try your request again after a few minutes
   - Check if [Solana Status](https://status.solana.com/) reports any ongoing issues
